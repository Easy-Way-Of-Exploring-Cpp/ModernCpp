Fly on Modern Cpp Feature


## Overview
Many of these descriptions and examples come from various resources for Modern Cpp tried to summarized in my own words.
  - [C++11 Features](https://github.com/Easy-Way-Of-Exploring-Cpp/ModernCpp/blob/master/C%2B%2B11.md)


Also tried to add simplified examples of Modern Cpp.
  - [C++11 Features Examples](https://github.com/Easy-Way-Of-Exploring-Cpp/ModernCpp/tree/master/Examples/Cpp-11)

## Compile all examples
  - Go to features example folder of cpp version
      * cd Examples/Cpp-11
      * make -j 4

## Compiler compatibility

Please see the documentation on what's currently supported by your compiler

* [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html) (preferably in combination with [libc++](http://libcxx.llvm.org/))
* [g++](http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html)

e.g. the initializer list code compiles only with g++ >= 4.4 or clang++ >= 3.1, which in the latter case is a rather current version

## To Do
 * Add realistic examples (mean not bookish examples shape class)
 * Add Modern Cpp Features of C++14, C++17
 
## Acknowledgements
* [cppreference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp) - especially useful for finding examples and documentation of new library features.
* [C++ Rvalue References Explained](http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html) - a great introduction I used to understand rvalue references, perfect forwarding, and move semantics.
* [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html) and [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html)'s standards support pages. Also included here are the proposals for language/library features that I used to help find a description of, what it's meant to fix, and some examples.
* [Compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org/)
* [Scott Meyers' Effective Modern C++](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996) - highly recommended book!
* [Jason Turner's C++ Weekly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHAlbZQNFU2LgEtiqd2Maw) - nice collection of C++-related videos.
* [What can I do with a moved-from object?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7027523/what-can-i-do-with-a-moved-from-object)
* And many more may be forgetting...
